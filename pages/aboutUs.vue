                            Inspired by a lifetime love of music and a commitment to make music accessible to all, Coach
                            House was created by experienced French polisher, Nick Rusling.

                            Having worked alongside an uncle, who ran the Bristol Piano Company, Nick was eager to share
                            his expertise in piano restoration.

                            With room for just 23 pianos, the Coach House initially comprised a small piano showroom and
                            a restoration and polishing workshop. However, as the word spread to the local community,
                            the company quickly outgrew the old building.

                            With a move to new, purpose-built facilities on Carmarthen Road and the support of his
                            brother Simon (who joined in 1993, training as a piano technician), as well as Jack Stevens
                            (previously of Duck, Son and Pinker), Coach House Pianos went from strength to strength.

                            The reputation of this close-knit team, and their passion for the subject, quickly allowed
                            them to establish long-lasting relationships with leading piano teachers, tuners and other
                            industry specialists. This network of expertise, and Nick’s knowledge of antique and unusual
                            pianos, continues to underpin and drive the business today.
